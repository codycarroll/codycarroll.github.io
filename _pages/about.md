I'm currently an assistant professor at the University of San Francisco, with joint appointments between the Math and Statistics department and the M.S. in Data Science Program. I'm also a cohost of the [USF Data Science Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/5SY1TPw3FubdSxCqrxUKZv) with Robert Clements. 


<!--- Broadly, I am interested in the treatment of complex structured data whose geometries thwart traditional, off-the-shelf statistical methods. In particular I am attracted to questions concerning functional and longitudinal data, especially when the functions are multivariate, contaminated by warping, or subject to constraints, as in the case of densities or monotonic curves. I received my PhD in Statistics at UC Davis while working with [Prof. Hans-Georg MÃ¼ller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/). A motivating example for much of my work arises in the study of human growth curves, in which several body measurements are tracked from infancy to adulthood. In my PhD, my methodological projects involved identifying systematic phase variation in growth spurts across both individuals and different modalities of growth (e.g. arms, legs, spine). My research approaches this problem by exploring models which can quantify intercomponent time dynamics for multivariate functional data, like time warping and time shifting frameworks. --->

I started my career as an educator in 2014, teaching English as a second language as at a high school in Nishinomiya, Japan. Since then I've taught statistics, math, and data science classes to undergraduate and graduate students at UC Davis and USF. 

As a researcher, I'm a fan of working as an applied statistician and data scientist. I like finding intuitive and creative ways of conveying results to break through the language barrier between statisticians and other scientists. In particular, I am attracted to questions concerning functional and longitudinal data, especially those whose geometries thwart traditional statistical methods.

My applied collaborations span a wide variety of domains: currently I have ongoing projects with conservationists at The Nature Conservancy, auditory researchers at UC San Diego, ophthalmologists at Stanford Medicine, and ecologists at UC Davis. In the past I've collaborated with scientists at the Gates Foundation, veterinarians at the San Diego Zoo, and the researchers behind Mt. Everest's Himalayan Database, among others.

With much of my working time spent behind a computer screen, I find a lot of value in connecting to nature when I have the chance. In free moments you'll probably find me road tripping or camping out at music festivals around Northern CA.
