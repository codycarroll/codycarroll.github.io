I'm currently an assistant professor at the University of San Francisco, with joint appointments between the Math and Statistics department and the M.S. in Data Science Program. I'm also a cohost of the [USF Data Science Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/5SY1TPw3FubdSxCqrxUKZv) with Robert Clements.

Broadly, I am interested in the treatment of complex structured data whose geometries thwart traditional, off-the-shelf statistical methods. In particular I am attracted to questions concerning functional and longitudinal data, especially when the functions are multivariate, contaminated by warping, or subject to constraints, as in the case of densities or monotonic curves. 

<!--- I received my PhD in Statistics at UC Davis while working with [Prof. Hans-Georg MÃ¼ller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/). A motivating example for much of my work arises in the study of human growth curves, in which several body measurements are tracked from infancy to adulthood. In my PhD, my methodological projects involved identifying systematic phase variation in growth spurts across both individuals and different modalities of growth (e.g. arms, legs, spine). My research approaches this problem by exploring models which can quantify intercomponent time dynamics for multivariate functional data, like time warping and time shifting frameworks. --->

Beyond developing methodology, I'm also a fan of working as a statistical consultant in my research. I like finding intuitive and creative ways of conveying results and breaking through the "language barrier" between statisticians and other scientists. My applied collaborations span a wide variety of domains: currently I have ongoing projects with conservationists at The Nature Conservancy, neuroscientists from the Salk Institute and UCSD, and opthalmic surgeons at Stanford Medicine. In the past I've collaborated with scientists at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, veterinarians at the San Diego Zoo, and the researchers behind Mt. Everest's Himalayan Database, to name a few. I am also a contributor and past maintainer of the R package [fdapace](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fdapace/index.html). 

With much of my working time spent behind a computer screen, I find a lot of value in connecting to the natural world when I have the chance. In free moments you'll probably find me on a trail, in a river, or road tripping around Northern CA.
