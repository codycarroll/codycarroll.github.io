Current Research Interests
---------------


My research generally falls into one of the following categories (or a combination thereof):

### Functional and longitudinal data analysis

Much of my methodological work focuses on functional and longitudinal data, particularly when the data involve multiple components or are subject to time warping. My PhD work with Hans-Georg Müller developed latent deformation models and cross-component registration methods for multivariate functional data, motivated by the study of human growth curves. These methods address systematic phase variation — like differences in the timing of growth spurts across individuals and body measurements. This line of work has appeared in *Biometrics* and contributed to the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fdapace/index.html" target="_blank">fdapace R package</a>.

### Conservation, citizen science, and wildlife

I collaborate extensively with conservation scientists, particularly at The Nature Conservancy and UC Davis. Current projects include validating participatory science data by comparing bird seasonality patterns across eBird and iNaturalist, developing satellite-based monitoring workflows for field flooding, and using large language models to accelerate groundwater sustainability plan reviews. I also maintain the <a href="https://github.com/codycarroll/birds_dash/" target="_blank">NorCal Bird Dashboard</a>, an interactive tool for exploring bird observation data across Northern California.

### Statistical modeling of healthcare data

On the biomedical side, I work with ophthalmologists at Stanford Medicine on predicting progressive vision loss in glaucoma patients using functional principal component analysis and electronic health records. I also collaborate with auditory researchers at UC San Diego, where our team developed <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/17584961" target="_blank">ABRA</a>, an open-source deep learning toolbox for automated auditory brainstem response analysis, recently accepted at *Scientific Reports*.
