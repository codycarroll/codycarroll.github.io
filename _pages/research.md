Current Research Interests
---------------


My research generally falls into one of three main categories (or a combination thereof):

+ **Time-dependent data & functional/longitudinal statistics**
+ **Ecological data & conservation technology** 
+ **Imaging, computer vision, & deep learning**


A full list of my publications can be found <a href="https://codycarroll.github.io/publications/"> here </a>.
